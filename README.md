![logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e461442-18d4-4039-8be2-b96e0000ceed)

A lightweight programming language designed for simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. It was made as a personal project to more deeply understand how programming languages work, and is not meant to be used outside of educational purposes.
## Key Features
- Multi-paradigm: Supports functional, object-oriented, and imperative programming styles.
- Typing Discipline: Dynamically typed, with weak typing.
- Execution Model: Interpreted.
- Memory Model: Centralized heap with scoped frames for managing references.
- Semantics: Reference semantics, where variables strictly store references to heap objects.
- Memory Management: Deterministic garbage collection that impliments reference counting.
- File Extension: .ks (Kickstart source files).
- Influences: Inspired by JavaScript, Python, and other flexible, high-level languages.
## Key Characteristics
### Object-Oriented Support:
- Functions are first-class objects, enabling object-oriented programming.
- Data structures, such as maps, can hold arbitrary types, making them versatile for various use cases.
- The garbage collector allows for references to objects to persist even if they go out of scope, as long as there are other active references.
### Simplicity and Flexibility:
- Designed to allow rapid prototyping and easy-to-understand syntax.
- Syntax that is simple and concise.
- Focused on flexibility, allowing paradigms to be mixed as needed for the task at hand.
