# Kickstart Language
![logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e461442-18d4-4039-8be2-b96e0000ceed)

A lightweight programming language designed for simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. It was made as a personal project to more deeply understand how programming languages work, and is not meant to be used outside of educational purposes.
## Key Features
- Multi-paradigm: Supports functional, object-oriented, and imperative programming styles.
- Typing Discipline: Dynamically typed, with weak typing.
- Execution Model: Interpreted.
- Memory Model: Centralized heap with scoped frames that manage references.
- Semantics: Reference semantics, where variables strictly point to objects in the heap.
- Memory Management: Deterministic garbage collection that impliments reference counting.
- File Extension: .ks (Kickstart source files).
- Influences: Inspired by JavaScript's syntax and design and Python's system model.
## Key Characteristics
- Designed to allow rapid prototyping.
- Syntax that is simple and concise.
- Focused on flexibility, allowing paradigms to be mixed as needed for the task at hand.
## Under the Hood
- Implimented in c++ 14 because it is compiled and has low level memory management.
- Easy to understand code base with a simple and modular class-based design that can very easily be extended and modified.
